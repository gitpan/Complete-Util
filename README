NAME
    Complete::Util - Shell tab completion routines

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.06 of Complete::Util (from Perl
    distribution Complete-Util), released on 2014-06-26.

FUNCTIONS
  complete_array(%args) -> array
    Complete from array.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   array* => *array*

    *   ci => *bool* (default: 0)

    *   word => *str* (default: "")

    Return value:

  complete_env(%args) -> array
    Complete from environment variables.

    On Windows, environment variable names are all converted to uppercase.
    You can use case-insensitive option ("ci") to match against original
    casing.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   ci => *bool* (default: 0)

    *   word => *str* (default: "")

    Return value:

  complete_file(%args) -> array
    Complete file and directory from local filesystem.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   d => *bool* (default: 1)

        Whether to include directory.

    *   f => *bool* (default: 1)

        Whether to include file.

    *   word => *str* (default: "")

    Return value:

  complete_hash_key(%args) -> array
    Complete from hash keys.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   ci => *bool* (default: 0)

    *   hash* => *hash*

    *   word => *str* (default: "")

    Return value:

  complete_program(%args) -> array
    Complete program name found in PATH.

    Windows is supported, on Windows PATH will be split using /;/ instead of
    /:/.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   word => *str* (default: "")

    Return value:

  mimic_shell_dir_completion(%args) -> array
    Make completion of paths behave more like shell.

    This function employs a trick to make directory/path completion work
    more like shell's own. In shell, when completing directory, the sole
    completion for "foo/" is "foo/", the cursor doesn't automatically add a
    space (like the way it does when there is only a single completion
    possible). Instead it stays right after the "/" to allow user to
    continue completing further deeper in the tree ("foo/bar" and so on).

    To make programmable completion work like shell's builtin dir
    completion, the trick is to add another completion alternative "foo/"
    (with an added space) so shell won't automatically add a space because
    there are now more than one completion possible ("foo/" and "foo/").

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   completion* => *str*

    Return value:

  parse_shell_cmdline(@args) -> hash
    Parse shell command-line for processing by completion routines.

    Currently only supports bash.

    Returns hash with the following keys: "words" (array of str, equivalent
    to "COMP_WORDS" provided by shell to completion routine), "cword" (int,
    equivalent to shell-provided "COMP_CWORD").

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   cmdline => *str*

        Command-line, defaults to COMP_LINE environment.

    *   opts => *hash*

        Currently known options: parse*line*sub (code).

    *   point => *int*

        Point/position to complete in command-line, defaults to COMP_POINT.

    Return value:
