NAME

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.13 of Complete::Util (from Perl
    distribution Complete-Util), released on 2014-07-13.

DESCRIPTION
FUNCTIONS
  complete_array_elem(%args) -> array
    Complete from array.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   array* => *array*

    *   ci => *bool* (default: 0)

    *   word => *str* (default: "")

    Return value:

  complete_env(%args) -> array
    Complete from environment variables.

    On Windows, environment variable names are all converted to uppercase.
    You can use case-insensitive option ("ci") to match against original
    casing.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   ci => *bool* (default: 0)

    *   word => *str* (default: "")

    Return value:

  complete_file(%args) -> array
    Complete file and directory from local filesystem.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   filter => *code|str*

        Only return items matching this filter.

        Filter can either be a string or a code.

        For string filter, you can specify a pipe-separated groups of
        sequences of these characters: f, d, r, w, x. Dash can appear
        anywhere in the sequence to mean not/negate. An example: "f" means
        to only show regular files, "-f" means only show non-regular files,
        "drwx" means to show only directories which are readable, writable,
        and executable (cd-able). "wf|wd" means writable regular files or
        writable directories.

        For code filter, you supply a coderef. The coderef will be called
        for each item with these arguments: $name. It should return true if
        it wants the item to be included.

    *   word => *str* (default: "")

    Return value:

  complete_hash_key(%args) -> array
    Complete from hash keys.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   ci => *bool* (default: 0)

    *   hash* => *hash*

    *   word => *str* (default: "")

    Return value:

  complete_program(%args) -> array
    Complete program name found in PATH.

    Windows is supported, on Windows PATH will be split using /;/ instead of
    /:/.

    Arguments ('*' denotes required arguments):

    *   word => *str* (default: "")

    Return value:
